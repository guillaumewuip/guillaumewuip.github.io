title: School project - Google Hashcode 2016

desc: >
    For the C++ course at Polytech Nantes, students had to work in teams of 5 to
    resolve the Google Hashcode 2016 final round. As the team leader I had to
    manage the work of each and deal with events in this very busy moment of the
    year (we were finally only 3 in the team). As a developer, I was in charge
    of implementing algorithms we want to test.
