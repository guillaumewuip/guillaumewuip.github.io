    In the context of presidential elections in France, I was the team leader of
    a 4-days datavisualization project involving design students, IT students
    and a journalist from <a href="http://ouest-france.fr">Ouest France</a>,
    a major french local newspaper. We worked on the sponsors of candidates and
    won the first prize of the contest. <br> The project has also been selected
    for the <a href="https://medium.com/data-journalism-awards/the-data-journalism-awards-2017-shortlist-6697cbac334f">DataJournalism Awards 2017</a>.
