title: Panorame - Des selfies d'envergure

desc: >
    During 6 month I've been involed  in the Panorame/Wisp project as the "tech guy".
    With 3 others, we were working on creating public camera that could be control
    by anyone with an mobile app. The project was tested in the Startup Weekend of
    Nantes.
    Funny story : a few months after we shut down the project, a Belgian launched a
    similar idea, with <a href="http://www.panora.me">the same name</a>!
