    I've participated in team in the Olympiades de Sciences de l'Ingénieur (a French contest for high school students in engineering) for the Nantes region, first, then at Paris for the final contest. Our project was the design of a inertial navigation unit with an Arduino. Here's the code : <a href="https://github.com/guillaumewuip/centrale-inertielle">sur Github</a>.
