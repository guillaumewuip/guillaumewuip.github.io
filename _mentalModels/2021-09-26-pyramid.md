The Pyramid is a great metaphorical mental model to reflect on _codebases._ With
the Pyramid in mind we see code arranged in blocks and layers.

Any codebase has at least one mission, whether it's providing a product
interface and its features, exposing an API or generating some data. The mission
is the value users extract from the codebase. It's the flag on top of the
Pyramid.

The Pyramid itself is not exposed directly to the users. It _supports_ the flag.
It supports the mission.

The metaphor sometimes takes a few liberties with reality. What's the difference
between a software Pyramid and a real one? 

Blocks in a real Pyramid are subject to gravity. They are constrained by
the weight of upper layer blocks. The highest blocks are also the freest.

Blocks in a software Pyramid are subject to dependency *coupling*. The freest
blocks are the lowest ones, having no dependency in the codebase. The most
constrained blocks are the highest one: they are indirectly coupled to the full
codebase.

Let's say we're removing Redux while seeing the affected codebase like a
Pyramid.

The flag - the mission - cannot change. And because each layer depends on the
one underneath, we can't update a block at a given level until we've migrated
the lower blocks they depend on first.

So what do we do? We update our Pyramid starting at the bottom - don't do this
with real pyramids!

We migrate the lowest-level blocks first while we keep supporting the
upper-level blocks. We give them a similar-enough API to continue working
without (much) refactoring needed. We progressively go up layer after layer,
following the dependency chain. When we see the flag again, we'll have
migrated the full codebase.
