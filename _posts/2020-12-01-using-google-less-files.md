*This is part 2 of [Using Google less]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2020-12-01-using-google-less.md %}),
a series of posts where I share how and why I've replaced Google services in my
day to day life.*

Here we are! We've decided to stop using Google services and we will start by
moving our files out of Google Drive.

Google Drive is two products in one.

### File hosting

Like a distant hard drive, we can use it to store any file.

It comes with its desktop companion app that will keep a local directory
synced with our distant Drive.
 
### A web-based office suite 

It works on proprietary file formats (Docs, Sheet, Slides, etc.) and its
killer feature for me is its collaboration mode.

My last use of Google Doc have been writing article drafts in order to share
them with friends.  We can work on the same file at the same time and they
can comment and suggest changes.

I'have also us Slides a lot in the past. I'm used to it and I reuse theme and
slides from one presentation into another.

We need to find alternatives for these two products.

# File hosting

Looking at the files I stored in Google Drive I realised they are very static.
There are administrative files, scan of my ID, payslips, things like that. There
are also data I've archived here from my student years.

No files I edit everyday and even less that I share with others. 

I only use my computer to access the files so the requirements for the
alternative are versy simple: 

- It should be easy to work with files locally (one computer only) and sync them
    (auto-sync would be great)
- No platform lock. I'm lot leaving Google Drive to be locked with another
    platform.
- No need for a too much space. A few dozen Go will be OK.
- Encryption + EU based hosting would be a plus
- Very cheap. It's "just" a distant disk actually, I'm not willing to pay much
    for that.

- Classic file hosting services like Dropbox, Box. But closed-source and hosted
    in the US.
- NextCloud, open-source all-in-one solution that you can even host yourself
