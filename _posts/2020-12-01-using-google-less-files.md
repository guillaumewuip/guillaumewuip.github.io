*This is part 2 of [Using Google less]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2020-12-01-using-google-less.md %}),
a series of posts where I share how and why I've replaced Google services in my
day to day life.*

Here we are! We've decided to stop using Google services and we will start by
moving our files out of Google Drive.

- intro
  - Google Drive = two things. File hosting + web-based office suite for text
      documents (Docs), spreadsheet (Sheet), presentation (Slides) and more

  - great service
    - with its macOS companion app, will sync your files locally 
    - collaboration works great
      - I used to write blog post drafts on Google Docs to share them with
          others and let them comment and suggest changes

- le cahier des charges
  - hosting
    - easy to work locally (one computer)
    - size: pas besoin de beaucoup
    - no platform lock
    - encryption + EU based would be great
    - pas trop cher
  - office suite alternative
    - TODO

# Altervatives

- Classic file hosting services like Dropbox, Box. But closed-source and hosted
    in the US.
- NextCloud, open-source all-in-one solution that you can even host yourself
- your VPS + rsync
