title: Using Google less

draft: false

page : false

---
I've been a faithful user of Google services for a long time. Search, Gmail,
Calendar, Drive, Photos, Translation, Chrome, Maps, etc. I've used a lot of
them. They provide a good user experience and are deeply integrated into one
another. Also, they are free or at least very cheap (I was paying 2â‚¬/month for
extra storage).

I've made Google *my personnal platform*. Growing up and learning how to use
Internet, I end up thinking that this was *the way* to use it. Does it sound
familiar?

But, years went by and I learnt more and more about fondamental issues with
Google (and others). You probably have heard of them too.

Platforms like Google have strong social and political impacts[^1] on
societies, not to mention what they do to privacy[^2]. There has also been
recent constroversy about the company acting against its own employees[^3].

At a more personal level, it simply doesn't feel right to give Google a
significant part of my life while they can abruptly shut down down my
account[^4].

How can one be alarmed about these issues and still use Google's services
personnaly? And still *pay* them?

Living with this paradox became harder and harder. It's no surprise that I woke
up one morning a few weeks ago and said to my self: "I should stop using
Google".

Now in the middle of my ["DeGoogle"](https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle) process,
it's the right time to share my plan. I hope it can inspire you. It's also a way
to force myself to continue on this not-so-easy path. Now that you've read that
I'm doing this it's harder for me to turn back.

Don't get me wrong. I still find Google products very powerfull. I will
certainly miss a lot of them.

But it's time to take control back.

# The plan 

My plan starts with two important axioms.

**I have a computer-science background and want to leverage it.** This will be a
bit hacky. That's OK. This is not a mainstream tutorial. I want to learn a bit
of the fondamentals behind the everyday tools.

I will also use this opportunity to use more free and opensource software.
Probably not GUIs but CLIs and terminal stuff a lot. After all I'm a heavy
VIM user: if I can use VIM to write mail I will be a happy person.

This choice will maybe also help me switch from macOS to Linux more easily one
day.

**I have a simple setup: One computer. One smartphone.** Nothing more. I use the
same computer for both personnal activities and work. I also use an iPhone,
mainly to read messages, calendar, etc., not more.

This will help me choose the alternatives that fit my needs.

Because it's a big project, let's cut it into smaller parts.

### Managing my [Files]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2020-12-01-using-google-less.md %})

Switching from Google Drive, Docs, Sheet, and Slides to S3 buckets, Github
and Markdown.

### An alternative for my [Mails]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2020-12-01-using-google-less.md %})

Replacing Gmail with an IMAP mailbox behind my own domain. How to make a
smooth transition between Gmail and the new mail? What mail client to use?

### A new [Calendar and contacts]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2020-12-01-using-google-less.md %}) solution

Using CalDAV and CardDAV standards to replace Google Calendar and Contacts.

### New browser and and new search engine (TBD)

Stop using Chrome and Google Search. Firefox? Safari? DuckDuckGo?

### Backup and share my Photos (TBD)

Google Photos was fabulous with its free unlimited storage, but it will be
[discontinued in June,
2021](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending).
I need to find an alternative.

That's it!

I'm used to other Google services but I find them easy to replace. I now use
[DeepL](deepl.com) instead of Translate. I've switch from Keep to
[Trello](http://trello.com/) a lot time ago and now Roam (waiting for Athens to
catch up).

    [The Social Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Dilemma) by
    Jeff Orlowski, ironically available on Netflix.

[^2]: There is a short TED Talk by Gleen Greenwald,
    [Why privacy matters](https://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters)
    that explains the danger of thinking "I've nothing to hide, so I see no
    problem in using services that make me loose my privacy".

[^3]: Just a few days ago they fired [Timnit Gebru](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/5/22155985/paper-timnit-gebru-fired-google-large-language-models-search-ai)
    from Google AI ethics team and have been accused again of [having spied on
    workers before firing them](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22047383/google-spied-workers-before-firing-labor-complaint).

[^4]: You don't have to be a "bad person" for Google to
    [shut down your account](https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/6sqgip/google_shuts_down_my_account_after_10_years_of).
    All you have to do after all is doing something that can be interpreted as
    against their terms of service.
