        <h3>Trello Team, </h3>

        <p>I am an enthusiastic French Computer Science student in his 4th year at the
            graduate school of engineering of the University of Nantes, France. Trello
            is a tool I use every day. A few days ago,
            <a href="https://medium.com/@guillaumewuip/how-i-use-trello-to-effectively-manage-my-student-life-on-a-daily-basis-1547668fa506#.73zll22wi">I wrote an article explaining how
                I use the service</a>.
        <p>This summer I have the opportunity to do a 3-month internship abroad and
            would relish the chance to work as a web developer intern for the innovative
            startup that creates the most important application in my daily
            life.</p>

        <br>

        <p>You are Trello. You make an awesome product <a
                href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2016/05/23/trello-get-serious-about-big-businesses-as-it-passes-1-1-million-daily-users-and-triples-sales">used
                by millions</a> of users and
            that is changing the way we work. Internally you seem to follow a set of
            <a href="https://trello.com/jobs">values</a> I find very respectful and that fit well with who I am.</p>
        <p>As a web and multi-platforms service, Trello uses technologies like Backbone,
            Node.JS, MongoDB or Redis. Past personal and professional experiences listed
            on my <a href="http://guillaume.wuips.com/CV_Guillaume-Clochard.pdf">CV</a>
            and <a href="http://guillaume.wuips.com/projects">website</a> gave me the chance to work with web technologies too.
            Working as a web developer for startups, introducing new technologies to
            people, being the “tech-guy” in multiple projects: all of this gave me
            opportunities to consolidate my skills on Javascript frameworks and
            libraries, web servers, databases and architectures that scale.</p>
        <p>Beside web technologies, my engineering background gave me classic Computer
            Science knowledge and more general skills like project management or user
            interface. Being a good student—I ranked 1st the past three years—I am also
            deeply involved in the daily life of the school. As a regular delegate and
            team leader I like to work with other people—student, teachers or
            clients—and I have always wanted to learn more. </p>
        <p>It is my passion to work on projects of all kinds, in groups or autonomously.
            For example, this year at school I am working on a Learning Analytics
            project with multiple actors to coordinate. A few months ago, I was part of
            <a href="http://www.lekte.co/">the team that won</a> the Startup Weekend of Nantes.</p>

        <br>

        <p>My internship would last at least 3 months between June and September 2017. I
            am free to work in the US and my school provides help for any administrative
            task. Here are more links and documents about me:

            <a href="http://guillaume.wuips.com">website</a>.</p>
        <p>I am eager to discuss this opportunity with you. My skills and my motivation
            should be interesting for a company like yours. Should you need any further
            information, references or recommendation letters I remain at your disposal

        <p>Sincerely,</p>
